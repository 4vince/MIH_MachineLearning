# Cross-Disaster Survival Analysis: What Actually Predicts Who Lives?

## Overview

This project starts with the classic Titanic survival-prediction problem, but
reframes the goal. Instead of asking *"can we predict whether a given
passenger survived?"*, it asks a more useful question:

> **Which passenger and situational characteristics consistently and
> meaningfully affect survival during a maritime evacuation — and does
> their importance hold across different disasters, or is it dependent
> on the disaster's own characteristics?**

A model trained only on the Titanic can't say whether "women and children
first" is a general rule or a one-off historical artifact. To find out, this
project pools passenger-level data from **two** maritime disasters — the
RMS Titanic (1912) and the RMS Lusitania (1915) — and tests whether
variables like `sex` and `pclass` behave the same way in both.

## Why two disasters, and why these two

The Titanic and Lusitania are an unusually clean natural experiment:
similar ship size, similar overall death rate (~69% vs ~67%), only three
years apart — but with one major difference: **the Titanic took ~2h40m to
sink, while the Lusitania sank in ~18 minutes.**

That time difference is the variable this project tests as a *moderator*:
does a slower disaster give social norms (like prioritizing women and
children) more time to reassert themselves, while a fast one favors
"selfish rationality"? Prior published research (Frey, Savage & Torgler,
PNAS) found evidence for exactly this pattern — this project re-derives
and tests that finding from the raw passenger-level data.

## Research approach

1. **Clean and standardize** both datasets independently (handle missing
   values, fix inconsistent categories, recode disaster-specific fields
   into a shared schema).
2. **Pool** the two cleaned datasets into one table, tagging each row with
   its `disaster` and `time_to_sink_min`.
3. **Model** survival with an emphasis on *interpretability over raw
   accuracy* — primarily logistic regression with an explicit interaction
   term (`sex_female × time_to_sink_min`), cross-checked against a Random
   Forest + SHAP analysis to catch anything nonlinear.
4. **Interpret**, not just report accuracy — the goal is to identify which
   patterns are structural (likely to generalize to future evacuation
   design) versus context-bound (artifacts of 1912–1915 social norms or
   ship layout).

## Dataset contents

### Titanic (`Titanic-Dataset.csv`) — 891 rows, 12 raw columns

| Column | Type | Missing | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PassengerId` | int | 0 | Row identifier, not predictive — dropped before modeling |
| `Survived` | int (0/1) | 0 | **Target variable** |
| `Pclass` | int (1/2/3) | 0 | Ticket class — proxy for socio-economic status |
| `Name` | text | 0 | Full name, formatted `Surname, Title. Firstname`; title can be extracted as a feature |
| `Sex` | text | 0 | `male` / `female` |
| `Age` | float | 177 (20%) | Missing disproportionately in 3rd class (28%) vs. 2nd class (6%) — not random, handled with group-based imputation |
| `SibSp` | int | 0 | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| `Parch` | int | 0 | Number of parents/children aboard |
| `Ticket` | text | 0 | Ticket number — often shared across multiple passengers (e.g. families), so `Fare` is per-ticket, not strictly per-person |
| `Fare` | float | 0 | Ticket price; includes legitimate `0` values (crew/line passes) and shared-ticket high values |
| `Cabin` | text | 687 (77%) | Cabin number — dropped, too sparse and mostly a unique identifier (147 unique values across only 204 known rows) |
| `Embarked` | text (S/C/Q) | 2 | Port of boarding: Southampton, Cherbourg, or Queenstown |

### Lusitania (`LusitaniaManifest.csv`) — 1,961 rows, 15 raw columns

| Column | Type | Missing | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Family name` | text | 0 | Surname — not predictive, dropped |
| `Title` | text | 0 | Honorific (Mr./Mrs./etc.) — not used, low priority |
| `Personal name` | text | 3 | First name(s) — not predictive, dropped |
| `Fate` | text (Saved/Lost) | 0 | **Target variable**, recoded to `survived` (1/0) to match Titanic |
| `Age` | float | 662 (34%) | Heavier missingness than Titanic — `Adult/Minor` used as a zero-missing fallback |
| `Department/Class` | text | 0 | Mixed field: passenger classes (`Saloon`, `Second`, `Third`) *and* crew departments (`Band`, `Deck`, `Engineering`, `Victualling`); recoded to `pclass` (1/2/3) after filtering to passengers only |
| `Passenger/Crew` | text | 0 | Used to filter the dataset down to passengers only, matching Titanic's passenger-only scope (1,265 passengers vs. 693 crew + 3 stowaways) |
| `Citizenship` | text | 2 | No Titanic equivalent — dropped |
| `Position` | text | 1,270 (65%) | Crew job title only — dropped, too sparse and not comparable to any Titanic field |
| `Status` | text | 1,170 (60%) | Unclear meaning, high missingness — dropped |
| `City` | text | 682 (35%) | Residence city, no Titanic equivalent — dropped |
| `Lifeboat` | text | 1,867 (95%) | Only populated for some survivors — kept aside as a validation check on `Fate`, not used as a model feature |
| `Rescue Vessel` | text | 1,810 (92%) | Same issue as `Lifeboat` — dropped |
| `Adult/Minor` | text | 0 | Zero-missing age category, used as a fallback where `Age` is missing |
| `Sex` | text | 0 | `Male` / `Female`, lowercased to match Titanic's `sex` formatting |

## Key variables

| Column | Meaning | Hypothesis it tests |
|---|---|---|
| `survived` | 1 = survived, 0 = did not | Target variable |
| `sex` | Passenger sex | "Women and children first" norm |
| `pclass` | Ticket class (1/2/3, Lusitania's Saloon/Second/Third recoded to match) | Socio-economic access to lifeboats |
| `age` | Passenger age | Age-based prioritization |
| `disaster` | Titanic or Lusitania | Which disaster the row belongs to |
| `time_to_sink_min` | Minutes from incident to sinking (160 vs. 18) | Moderator: does evacuation speed change which norms hold? |

## Findings so far (exploratory)

| | Titanic | Lusitania |
|---|---|---|
| Female survival rate | 74.0% | 37.3% |
| Male survival rate | 18.9% | 38.0% |
| 1st class survival rate | 62.6% | 39.2% |
| 3rd class survival rate | 24.2% | 35.9% |

On the Titanic, sex and class strongly predict survival. On the Lusitania,
both effects nearly disappear. This is the pattern the pooled interaction
model is being built to test formally.

## Status

- [x] Load, clean, and filter Titanic dataset
- [x] Load, clean, and filter Lusitania dataset (passengers isolated from crew)
- [x] Pool both datasets into a shared schema
- [ ] Impute missing age within the pooled dataset
- [ ] Fit logistic regression with `sex_female × time_to_sink_min` interaction term
- [ ] Cross-check with Random Forest + SHAP
- [ ] Write up findings: which patterns are structural vs. context-bound

## Important caveat

This project explicitly does **not** aim to predict any specific future
individual's survival odds. The goal is to identify general, transferable
evacuation-relevant factors — useful for thinking about safety design and
protocol, not for forecasting outcomes for a real person in a future
disaster. Pooling also assumes the two ships are comparable except for the
variables modeled here; other differences (wartime vs. peacetime context,
nationality mix, era-specific ticketing) aren't captured and are noted as
a limitation rather than resolved.
